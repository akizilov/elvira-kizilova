            <h3><b>My Journey into Teaching</b></h3>
            <p>I come from a family with a rich tradition in education. My grandmother was a math teacher and school vice-principal, my father taught art, and my mother was a high school history teacher. Surrounded by educators, I grew up admiring the impact they had on their students' lives. Over time, I realized I had inherited that same passion for teaching and a deep desire to share knowledge and inspire others.</p>
            <p>My teaching journey began in Ukraine, where I worked as a part-time university lecturer while holding an M.S. in Management. From 2009 to 2010, I taught undergraduate courses such as Decision Making Methods and Entrepreneurship, as well as graduate-level classes in Theoretical Foundations of Management and Tourism Management.</p>
            <p>After moving to the United States to pursue a doctoral degree at West Virginia University, I continued developing my teaching skills. I led undergraduate courses in Marketing, Buyer Behavior, International Marketing, and International Business</p>
