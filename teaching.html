            <br>
            <P>I come from a family with a rich background in education: my grandmother was a math
                teacher and a school vice-principal, my father was a teacher of arts, and my mother taught history
                in high school. When I grew up, I realized that I inherited a passion for teaching and transferring
                my knowledge to other people. I was a university lecturer in my home country, Ukraine, and
                decided to pursue a career as an educator in the United States. I believe that a good educator plays
                an important role in shaping studentsâ€™ future and serves as a role model, so it is important to me
                that I do my best in educating and mentoring the students.</P>
            <P>I have had several experiences that have helped me in my early stages as a faculty
                member. I worked in Ukraine as a part-time lecturer. As a holder of a M.S. degree in
                Management, in 2009-2010, I taught Decision Making Methods and Entrepreneurship in Ukraine
                to undergraduate students and Theoretical Foundations of Management and Tourism Management
                to graduate students. As a doctoral candidate at West Virginia University, I have taught two
                undergraduate courses: Buyer Behavior and Global Marketing. I also served as a guest lecturer in
                Global Marketing, Marketing Research, and Tourism Management courses at West Virginia
                University.
            </P>
            <P>
                Currently, as an Assistant Professor at Dominican University, I teach four courses: Marketing, International Marketing, International Business, and Doing Business Around the World (Latin America and Asia).My teaching philosophy is based on three key components: engagement, preparation for business careers, and fairness.
            </P>
