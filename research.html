            <P>My primary research interests are consumer well-being, emotions, and perceptions. This
                work covers multiple domains and contexts including consumer interactions with service
                environments (e.g., clinical, retail, and tourism) and related emotions that affect consumer well-
                being. I am interested in conducting research projects that have significant managerial and public
                policy implications and positive impact on consumer well-being. I use lab and field experiments,
                survey research, and quantitative methods of analysis. I am very interested in expanding my
                knowledge of content analysis. I believe that analysis of large Internet datasets, including social
                media data and corporate published materials, makes a strong contribution to the field of
                marketing.
            </P>
            <p>My research work to date can be broken into three streams. The first studies access to
                health services from the consumers’ perspective, examining subjective (vs. objective)
                consumers’ perception of access. Through scale development and a series of three studies, the
                initial paper demonstrates that perceived access impacts perceived vulnerability, health-related
                behaviors and attitudes (such as distrust in a health care system and health motivation), and
                consumers’ overall health. We also extend these theoretical findings to various contexts,
                including the COVID-19 pandemic. Our second paper explores the role of perceived access to
                health care and pandemic fear in preventative COVID-19 behaviors and maintaining overall
                health and mediating effects of consumer vulnerability and health system concerns. Our third
                paper examines how U.S. abortion laws influence consumers’ subjective perceptions of access to
                health care and their overall health and well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
                My second research stream explores how consumers process nutritional information
                presented with different formats of front-of-package (FOP) labels under different purchasing
                conditions. In this paper, we use two types of FOP labels: symbol-based (evaluative) and text-
                based (objective). In a series of lab and field studies, we test which consumers identify the
                healthiest product more easily, when they process label information directly vs. indirectly, and
                how their choices differ depending on the presence (vs. absence) of diet-related diseases. We are
                currently collecting online data for our second study.
            </p>
            <p>
                My third research stream examines the role of anthropomorphic cues in promoting
                sustainable hedonic products and services. Specifically, we study the effectiveness of sustainable
                communications in tourism. Drawing on relationship marketing theory, we propose that
                including anthropomorphic cues and positive emotional framing in sustainability
                communications will increase positive consumer behavioral intentions through the perception of
                goal congruence and brand connectedness. This research contributes to the literature on
                sustainable communications and anthropomorphism and has clear managerial implications. We
                are currently designing and pretesting experimental stimuli for our second study.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future, I will continue to work in the areas of consumer emotions and perceptions 
                that affect well-being, including extending sustainability labeling research to various cultures.
                Travel destinations are primarily promote themselves internationally, and sustainable attitudes
                and behaviors, as well as legal and societal norms and practices, vary across different cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I will explore positive and negative effects of anthropomorphism on
                consumer well-being. Most research has focused on anthropomorphism’s positive consequences
                for businesses. However, I would like to explore the consequences of anthropomorphism for
                consumers, including whether it induces consumer happiness and does not impose psychological
                threats.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would also like to further explore consumer vulnerability in the war and post-war
                contexts. For example, the current war in Ukraine made many people vulnerable, whether they
                had to flee from their homes to other countries or stayed at home and had to survive Russian
                attacks. Some people became internally displaced twice – in 2014, when Russia occupied Crimea
                and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, and now in 2022. I would like to study how
                internally displaced people and refugees cope with their vulnerability. Other research streams
                may focus on war-and post war consumption of cosmetic products and beauty services and other
                types of hedonic consumption.
