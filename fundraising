        <h1>Fundraising for Ukraine</h1>
        <p>In response to the Russian war in Ukraine, I organized a bake sale to support people in military zones. Dominican nutrition students baked Ukrainian-themed cookies that were sold during the Business Idea Competition event on campus. In addition, I designed  flyers that were distributed at the Graduate, Undergraduate Research, Scholarship, Creative Investigation, and Experiential Learning EXPO. <br> 
        We raised $1,800 that was sent to Ukrainian Women's League, an organization that delivers humanitarian aid to children and elderly located in war zones and cities recently liberated from Russian troops, such as Chernihiv, Mariupol, Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, and Vorzel.</p>
