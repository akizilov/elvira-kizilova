            <p>Welcome!</p>
            <p class="about">I’m so glad you’re here. I’m an Assistant Professor of Marketing and International Business at Dominican University, where I have the privilege of teaching and mentoring students in areas I’m passionate about - marketing, consumer behavior, international marketing, and international business.</p>   
            <p class="about">My academic journey has taken me across countries and disciplines. I hold M.P.A. degrees from both the University of Arkansas and the Odessa Regional Institute of Public Administration under the President of Ukraine, along with B.S. and M.S. degrees in Management from the Crimean Institute of Nature Protection and Resort Construction.</p>
            <p class="about">My research explores how marketing impacts consumer well-being, especially among vulnerable populations, and how it can support more sustainable and ethical practices. You can find my work in journals like the Journal of Public Policy & Marketing and the Journal of Consumer Affairs. I also enjoy sharing my research at conferences such as the AMA Winter Academic Conference, the Marketing and Public Policy Conference, and the Society for Marketing Advances.</p>
            <p class="about">Before academia, I worked with the Ministry of Health Resorts and Tourism of Crimea and contributed to international development initiatives through USAID and the European Union. These experiences deeply shaped my interest in global markets and sustainable development. </p>
            <p class="about">Thanks for stopping by. I invite you to explore my work, connect, or just say hello!</p>
