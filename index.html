            <p class="about">I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing and International Business at Dominican University. In addition, I hold M.P.A degrees from the University of Arkansas and Odessa Regional Institute of Public Administration Under the President of Ukraine, and B.S. and M.S. degrees in Management from the Crimean Institute of Nature Protection and Resort Construction, Ukraine. <br><br>
                My research interests include consumer well-being and vulnerability; sustainability marketing, and tourism marketing.  My research has recently been published in the Journal of Public Policy & Marketing and the Journal of Consumer Affairs. I regularly present my work at the national conferences, such as the Winter American Marketing Association Conference, Marketing and Public Policy Conference, and the Society for Marketing Advances Conference. <br><br>
                My teaching experience includes teaching undergraduate and graduate consumer behavior, international marketing, principles of marketing, international business, and management courses.              
                Prior to pursuing a doctoral degree, I worked for the Ministry of Health Resorts and Tourism of Crimea, Ukraine. I also was a local expert of technical assistance programs, such as USAID LINK, USAID BIZPRO, and European Union Project "Crimean Tourism Diversification and Support".
